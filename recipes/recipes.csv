1757,2 hrs 20 mins,"Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.,Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).,Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.,Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.

Now, while the method could not be easier, there are a couple things that this method requires: a full-size, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that indicates when it is preheated. Older ovens with manual controls can vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation. Here's another pro tip for you: Because prime rib is expensive, you should always insert a probe-style thermometer to monitor the internal temp of your roast and avoid any chance of over-cooking. Set the probe alarm (125 F for medium-rare) just in case, and pull the prime rib from oven even if there's still time left on the oven timer.",4,"
