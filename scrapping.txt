Scrapy - very fast
Made using twisted, an event driven networking framework
Has asynchronize capabilities - doesn't wait for response when dealing with multiple requests
Portable - requires no dependencies unlike beautiful soup - works on every operating system

Spider - define how a site should be scraped, what information will be got, etc. - defined as classes

Selectors - mechanisma for selecting data
eg. links = response.xpath('//a/@href')
divs = response.xpath('//div')
paragraphs = response.xpath('//p/')

Items = data extracted from the selectors - 'containers' for data
Defines the structure of scrapped data and fields it should have

Itemloaders = 

(((((((((python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip))))))))) - updating pip
